```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
# library("jpeg")
```

## Setup (beginning of class)
- Please download `class_files` from [GitHub](https://github.com/FRS417-DataScienceBiologists)
- Please open your homework in RStudio
- Open a browser window to your GitHub repository
- Check in right working directory 'getwd()'


## Tidyverse
- A collection of packages designed to work together for data analysis
- Consistent, intuitive, and much easier to use
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("tidyverse1.png")
library(tidyverse)
```


## Overview for Today's Lab
1. Review any homework questions.
      - what does glimpse give that names doesn't? gives dimensions, and esp class of data (int, num, etc.)
      - to pick things, 'subset()' base R code, not tidyverse; easier to use 'select()'
      - 'mean(__$__)' base R code but it's helpful to find average
      - 'arrrange()' vs. 'order()': arrange by alphabetical, using order lets you order way you want 
2. Learn and practice dplyr.
3. Learn and practice tidyr.
    - tidy data
    - less conceptually intuitive

### Lab 3-1 Review

## Review filter() and select()

Load the fish scale data
Here we load a .csv file with data on fish scales. We open the file using `read_csv()`. 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fish <- 
  readr::read_csv("C:/Users/Apple/Desktop/aptruong/data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```

Review what's actually in the df
```{r}
glimpse(fish)
```
> Note: filter allows you to think in rows, can take rows out of df that correspond to variables of interest

Check col names so you're calling the right variables of interest
```{r}
colnames(fish)
```

# filter()
use pipes, can combine mult filters to further refine df
```{r}
fish %>% 
  filter(lakeid=="AL",
        length == 167)
# piping fish into a filter looking for a specific lakeid and length
```

# select()
Select allows you to build a new data frame by selecting your columns (variables) of interest. Our fish data only has six columns, but this should give you some ideas especially when you have large data frames with lots of columns.  

We are only interested in lakeid and scalelength.
```{r}
select(fish, lakeid, scalelength)
```

The `-` operator is useful in select. It allows us to select everything except the specified variables.
```{r}
select(fish, -fish_id, -annnumber, -length, -radii_length_mm)
```

For very large data frames with lots of variables, `select()` uses many different operators to make things easier. Let's say we are only interested in the variables that deal with length.
```{r}
# selects all col that has anything to do w/ length, helpful in df w/ lots of col
select(fish, contains("length"))
```


Some additional options to select columns based on a specific criteria include:  
1. ends_with() = Select columns that end with a character string  
2. contains() = Select columns that contain a character string  
3. matches() = Select columns that match a regular expression  
4. one_of() = Select columns names that are from a group of names  

>Note: filter() and select() can go in any order


## Practice: select()

1. What are the names of the columns in the `fish` data?
```{r}
colnames(fish)
```

2. We are only interested in the variables `lakeid`, `length`, and `scalelength`. Use `select()` to build a new dataframe focused on these variables.

```{r}
fish_length <- fish %>% 
  select(lakeid, length, scalelength )
fish_length
```


## Dplyr: Can we combine filter() and select()?
Absolutely. This is one of the strengths of the tidyverse, it uses the same grammar to specify commands.
```{r}
fish2 <- select(fish, lakeid, scalelength)
```

```{r}
filter(fish2, lakeid=="AL")
```

# Combine filter() and select() using a pipe
The code above works fine but there is a more efficient way. We need to learn pipes `%>%`. Pipes allow you to feed the output from one function to the input of another function. We are going to use pipes from here on to keep things cleaner. (command+shift+m)
```{r}
fish%>%
  select(lakeid, scalelength)%>%
  filter(lakeid=="AL")
```


# Practice
1. Build a dataframe focused on the lakes `AL` and `AR` and looking at radii length between 2 and 4 only. Use pipes!

```{r}
# Filter the data to include fish only from lake AL and with a scalelength greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4.
fish%>%
  select(lakeid, scalelength)%>%
  filter(lakeid=="AL"| lakeid=="AR")%>%
  filter(scalelength >= 2 & scalelength <= 4)

# can also do
# filter(scalelength >= 2,
#       scalelength <= 4)
```

## Other functions in dplyr
> Note: Make sure to do reality checks to see if filters are working (like if it's within certain numbers)

#arrange(): allows us to sort values in a column.
Arrange in desc order
```{r}
fish %>% 
  arrange(desc(scalelength))
```

Can also arrange characters (will sort alphabetically)
```{r}
fish %>%
  arrange(lakeid)
```

It can be very helpful in combination with the other functions.
```{r}
fish %>% 
  select(lakeid, length, fish_id, scalelength) %>% 
  filter(lakeid=="AL") %>% 
  arrange(fish_id)
```

# Practice: arrange()
1. Build a dataframe focused on the scalelengths of `fish_id` 300 and 301. Use `arrange()` to sort from smallest to largest scalelength. Use pipes!
```{r}
fish %>%
  select(fish_id, scalelength) %>% 
  filter(fish_id==300 | fish_id==301) %>% 
  arrange(scalelength)

#only need to add 'desc' after arrange if want to fo high to low; going low to high doesn't need it
```

#count(): Can get a sense of range
```{r}
fish %>% 
  count(lakeid)
# so 383 for AL, 262 for AR, etc.
```

#mutate(): Can create new col in df
`mutate()` is used to add new columns to a data frame. When you use mutate() the original data used are preserved. We will briefly practice `mutate()` here and come back to it in more detail later.  
```{r}
fish %>%
  select(lakeid, fish_id, scalelength, length) %>% 
  filter(lakeid=="AL") %>% 
  arrange(fish_id) %>% 
  mutate(scale_ratio=(length/scalelength))

#mutate(newcolname=(_______)) <--- must use variables you selected
```

```{r}
names(fish)
```

## Practice
1. Add a new column to the fish data that is radii_length_mm divided by scalelength. Add another column that scales this number to a percentage.
```{r}
fish %>%
  select(radii_length_mm, scalelength) %>% 
  mutate(radii_length_ratio=(radii_length_mm/scalelength)) %>% 
  mutate(radii_length_ratio_per=(radii_length_ratio*100))
```



### Lab 3-2

> **For Big-Data Scientists, ‘Janitor Work’ Is Key Hurdle to Insights.**  
> "Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in the mundane labor of collecting and preparing data, before it can be explored for useful information."

## Overview
The  quote sums above sums up much of the work in data science. Simply put, most of the data that you end up working with will be messy, disorganized, and not **tidy**. By the end of the course, you will become a master of wrangling messy data into tidy data that are organized and ready for analysis.

In R should have ...
- every variable in own col
- every observation in own row
- every value in own cell

- [Data wrangling cheatsheet (`dplyr`,`tidyr`)](http://ucsb-bren.github.io/refs/cheatsheets/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
- [Tidyr, R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#unite)

## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Explain the difference between tidy and messy data.  
2. Evaluate a dataset as tidy or untidy.  
3. Use the functions of tidyr to transform messy data to tidy data.

## Load the library
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Tidy data
Most data that you will encounter are organized incorrectly for work in R and, as you might expect, the tools used to transform data are a core part of the tidyverse. I will attempt to summarize the most important points below, but you should read chapter 12 of the data science text (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).  

`Tidy` data in the sense of the tidyverse follows three conventions:   
(1) each variable has its own column  
(2) each observation has its own row  
(3) each value has its own cell  

This is summarized in the image below.  
![*Tidy Data.*](tidy-1.png)
I think this, and many other, explanations of tidy data are good but they don't emphasize a key point: R was built around working with vectors (which are stored as columns) and this is inherent in how it uses data. So, in order for many of the functions in R to work data need to be organized accordingly. The package used to tidy data is called **tidyr** and is a core part of the tidyverse.  

## Tidyr
+ `gather()` and `spread()` convert data between wide and long format  
+ `separate()` and `unite()` separates or unites information in columns  

The following data are results from a drug trial that shows the effect of four different treatments on six patients. The values represent resting heart rate.
```{r}
non_tidy1 <- data.frame(
  patient= c("Margaret", "Frank", "Hawkeye", "Trapper", "Radar", "Henry"),
  a= c(72, 84, 64, 60, 74, 88),
  b= c(74, 84, 66, 58, 72, 87),
  c= c(80, 88, 68, 64, 78, 88),
  d= c(68, 76, 64, 58, 70, 72)
)
non_tidy1
```
Let's assess whether or not these data are tidy.  

(1) each variable has its own column  
*No. The columns are actually variables (drug a, b, c, d aren't col names, they're names of var, correct col should be drug with var a, b, c, d)*  
(2) each observation has its own row  
*No. The observations are grouped in a single row by patient.*  
(3) each value has its own cell  
*Yes. There are no unusual combinations of data in each cell.*    

> Note: R thinks in vectors (data must be same type). In excel, this would make sense but to R, it doesn't because each col aren't correct vectors. 

Because rules 1 and 2 are violated, these data are **not** tidy. We need to use tidyr to make them useable in R. As a final demonstration, let's plot these data. We haven't covered plots yet but this is a good first example.
```{r}
plot(non_tidy1)
```
R cannot make sense of these data; the plot is nonsense. Even though I gave no specific plotting instructions, R should be able to produce something intelligible or ask you to identify axes.  

## Why are data untidy? 
Scientists frequently use excel spreadsheets that are organized to make data entry efficient. This is typically referred to as **wide format**. From an R perspective, this creates problems because R fundamentally works with vectors. If you have a column of mixed classes or values that correspond to more than a single variable then many of the important R functions will not work.  

By far, the most common problem is to have **column names actually represent values of a variable**. Our `non_tidy1` example has columns a, b, c, and d that actually represent different drug trials.  

## gather()
gather() is the function used most when dealing with non-tidy data. It allows us to transform wide data into long data.  
```{r}
non_tidy1
```

The syntax to gather() is a bit strange. From the [Tidyr, R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#unite) text, you need to know three things in order to use the function:  

(1) The set of columns that represent values, not variables.  
*In our case, these are the different drug treatment columns a, b, c, d.*
(2) The name of the variable whose values form the column names.  
*This is called the key, and in our data this is the drug. What is the new column name?*
(3) The name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells.  
*This is called the value, and in our case is the heart rate.*

Need to
```{r}
tidy1 <- non_tidy1 %>% 
  gather(a, b, c, d, key="drug", value="heartrate")
tidy1

# syntax is: gather(*tell what to gather*, key= *new colname*, value= *value want in*)
# now see how each drug affect each person
```
> Think: is df going to get larger or smaller? it gets bigger

Now, we can reverify by doing our tidy check.  

(1) each variable has its own column  
*Yes. Patient, drug, and heartrate are separated into individual columns.*  
(2) each observation has its own row  
*Yes. Each row has exactly one observation broken down by drug. (before, had mult observations)*  
(3) each value has its own cell  
*Yes. There are no unusual combinations of data in each cell.*   

And, as a final check let's try the plot command again. I do need to tell R the x and y axes.
```{r}
plot(tidy1$patient, tidy1$heartrate)
```
> Note: this plot looks crappy, but for now it's just proof of concept (showing that R is now understanding and working correctly w/ vectors)

## Practice
The data below track tuberculosis infection rates by year and country.
```{r}
country <- c("Afghanistan", "Brazil", "China")
`1999` <- c(745, 37737, 212258)
`2000` <- c(2666, 80488, 213766)
tb_data <- data.frame(country=country, `1999`=`1999`, `2000`=`2000`)
tb_data
```

1. Are these data tidy? Why not? Identify the specific problem(s).
> Stored as separate values rather that into a data frame

2. Use gather() to tidy the data.
```{r}
tb_data %>% 
  gather('X1999', 'X2000', key="year", value="rate")
```


## separate()
In our next example, we have  the sex of each patient included with their name. Are these data tidy? No, there is more than one value per cell in the patient column (name and sex) and the columns a, b, c, d once again represent values.
```{r}
non_tidy2 <- data.frame(
  patient= c("Margaret_f", "Frank_m", "Hawkeye_m", "Trapper_m", "Radar_m", "Henry_m"),
  a= c(72, 84, 64, 60, 74, 88),
  b= c(74, 84, 66, 58, 72, 87),
  c= c(80, 88, 68, 64, 78, 88),
  d= c(68, 76, 64, 58, 70, 72)
)
```

We need to start by separating the patient names from their sexes. `separate()` needs to know which column you want to split, the names of the new columns, and what to look for in terms of breaks in the data.
```{r}
non_tidy2 %>% 
  separate(patient, into= c("patient_name", "sex"), sep = "_")
# tell you want seperated, how you want it to be seperated into, and how are they seperated by
```

This is great; we have separated sex from patient. Are the data tidy? Not yet. We still need to use `gather()`.
```{r}
tidy2 <- non_tidy2 %>% 
  separate(patient, into= c("patient_name", "sex"), sep = "_") %>% 
  gather(a, b, c, d, key="drug", value="heartrate")
tidy2
```
Now the data is tidy!

## unite()
`unite()` is the opposite of separate(). It's syntax is relatively straightforward. You only need to identify the key and the value.
```{r}
tidy2 %>% 
  spread(key="drug", value="heartrate") %>% 
  unite(patient_sex, patient_name, sex, sep="_")
```

## rename()
The rename function is actually part of *dplyr*, but I put it here because I think of it as part of transforming untidy data.
```{r}
tidy2
```

Let's say I don't like the names of the columns. They can be renamed, just remember to replace or build a new object to keep things clean. (syntax is *new name* = *old name*)
```{r}
tidy_3 <-
  tidy2 %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    MASH_character = patient_name,
    Sex = sex,
    Drug = drug,
    Heartrate_bpm = heartrate)
```

## Practice
In this example study, ten participants were asked to categorize three face styles by clicking various buttons that represent three different categories (face 1, face 2, face 3). The time it took to click a button is in milliseconds.
```{r}
faces <- data.frame(
  ParticipantID_sex = c("001_m", "002_f", "003_f", "004_f", "005_m", "006_f", "007_m", "008_m", "009_m", "010_f"),
  Face_1 = c(411,723,325,456,579,612,709,513,527,379),
  Face_2 = c(123,300,400,500,600,654,789,906,413,567),
  Face_3 = c(1457,1000,569,896,956,2345,780,599,1023,678)
)
faces
```

1. Are these data tidy? Why or why not?  
> No

2. Tidy the data and place them into a new dataframe.
```{r}
faces_tidy <- faces %>% 
  separate(ParticipantID_sex, into=c("ParticipantID", "Sex"), sep="_") %>% 
  gather(Face_1, Face_2, Face_3, key="Type", value="Time")
faces_tidy
```

3. Use `rename()` to rename a few columns for practice.
```{r}
faces_tidy_2 <-
  faces_tidy %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    Participant_ID = ParticipantID,
    Sex = Sex,
    Face_type = Type,
    Time_ms = Time)
faces_tidy_2
```
